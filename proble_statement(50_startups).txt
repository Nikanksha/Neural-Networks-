Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_startups data.
Do transformations for getting better predictions of profit
and
make a table containing R^2 value for each prepared model.

R&D Spend -- Research and devolop spend in the past few
years
Administration -- spend on administration in the past few years
Marketing Spend -- spend on Marketing in the past 
few years
State -- states from which data is collected
Profit  -- profit of each state in the past few years

Fitting the Multiple Linear Regression in the Optimal Training set

X_opt_Train, X_opt_Test = train_test_split(X_opy,test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)
regressor.fit(X_opt_Train, Y_Train)

# Predicting the Optimal Test set results

Y_opt_Pred = regressor.predict(X_opt_Test)
